His hands on treatments will not alter the fact that I am 85 years old, but his treatment makes the aging process much more enjoyable and pain free."</p>

                            <p>"Henry is a cheerful, easy going, and accessible man. He receives each person on their own terms without judgement. I see Henry primarily for Feldenkrais and Craniosacral and find that his approach is truly healing. Body, mind, and soul are not separate entities. They are all expressed and accessed through the body. Henry's quality of intent and experience touches all levels."</p>

They have changed my sense of what massage can (and should) be. In addition his manner is warm, respectful, and relaxed and his schedule is very accommodating."</p>
